# Samsung PRISM Hackathon - Team TutoriAI

## :gear: Problem Statement 
Existing after-school tuition classes lack adaptability and struggle with accessibility, limiting students' potential. Our platform, blending Generative AI and VR, enriches learning with flexible one-on-one tutor sessions, saving students time and ensuring universal acces to quality education.


## 👩‍🎓 TutoriAI 
-> Meet TutoriAI, your personal 3D VR tutor, dedicated to making Machine Learning concepts easy and enjoyable to learn.

-> Featuring 7 comprehensive ML modules, TutoriAI provides recaps and tests after each module to ensure you grasp all the concepts.

-> Also up-to-date with the latest AI advancements by Samsung, perfect for when you need a quick break :)

## :open_file_folder: Dataset
The training dataset is made up of 16 robotic procedures. The original video data was recorded at 60 Hz and to reduce labelling cost they have been subsampled to 2 Hz. Sequences with little or no motion are manually removed to leave 149 frames per procedure. Video frames are 1280x1024 for which labeling is provided.  

The classes found in the training and test are:  
 - Instrument   
 - Drop in Ultrasound Probe  
 - Suturing Needles  
 - Suturing thread  
 - Clips/clamps  
 - Background tissue  
  
Each class will have a distinct numerical label in a ground truth image. A supplied json file will contain the class name to numerical label mapping.
