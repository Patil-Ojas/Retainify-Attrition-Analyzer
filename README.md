## :hourglass_flowing_sand: How to run TutoriAI? 

 - TutoriAI has been developed for 2 environments, 3D and VR.
 - To only run TutoriAI, download 'Additional Builds' folder located in Documents.
 - Extract the folder, run the .exe file.
 - The 3D model has been tried and tested, however we were unable to test the VR model, due to unavailability of HMD consoles. Rest assured, we left no stone unturned in the VR development.
