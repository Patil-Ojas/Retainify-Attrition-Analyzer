# Samsung PRISM Hackathon - Team TutoriAI

## :gear: Problem Statement 
Existing after-school tuition classes lack adaptability and struggle with accessibility, limiting students' potential. Our platform, blending Generative AI and VR, enriches learning with flexible one-on-one tutor sessions, saving students time and ensuring universal acces to quality education.


## 👩‍🎓 TutoriAI 
-> Meet TutoriAI, your personal 3D VR tutor, dedicated to making Machine Learning concepts easy and enjoyable to learn.

-> Featuring 7 comprehensive ML modules, TutoriAI provides recaps and tests after each module to ensure you grasp all the concepts.

-> Also up-to-date with the latest AI advancements by Samsung, perfect for when you need a quick break :)

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: How to run TutoriAI? 

 - TutoriAI has been developed for 2 environments, 3D and VR.
 - First, clone the repo.
 - Using Unity open the scene named "Tutoriai".
 - The 3D model has been tried and tested, however we were unable to test the VR model, due to unavailability of HMD consoles. Rest assured, we left no stone unturned in the VR development.
